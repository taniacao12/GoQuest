## Description
Immersive exploration game in an ever-changing grid world.
More info on purpose and inspiration.

## How It Works
Our Unity program is made up of two main components: the player and the environment. At the start of the game, the environment is auto-generated to create a unique experience for the user every time the game is played. Once the game begins, the player may roam around the environment. Certain actions will trigger events such as the activation of floating tiles, extrusion of tiles, and revealment of tile traps. As the player begins to adapt to this world, the environment will adapt and begin to change to enhance the user's immersion in the game.
